# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-10-12

### Added

- `<c-marquee>`, a row of anything that travels across the page without end. It moves by CSS
  alone, stops under the pointer and while anything in it has focus, holds still under reduced
  motion, and draws a pause control. `speed` is a number, and `reverse`, `gap`, `fade`, `controls`
  and `pause` are its other options. `<c-marquee.pause>` is the control on its own.
- A logos family, for sponsors and participating organisations. `<c-logos.belt>` is one line of
  logos under a heading, `<c-logos.rows>` is several lines running opposite ways,
  `<c-logos.inline>` is a slim band with a label beside it, `<c-logos.tiers>` lists sponsors by
  level, and `<c-logos.split>` puts the request to join beside the logos. `<c-logos.logo>`,
  `<c-logos.tile>` and `<c-logos.tier>` are the parts. `tone` draws every logo in a block as it
  is, muted until hovered, or as its shape in the text colour.

### Changed

- The blocks now rely on daisyUI's `btn-circle` class from the project, part of daisyUI 5.
- A logo writes its image's address to its `style` attribute, for the `ink` tone. Until now only
  numbers were written there.

### Fixed

- `<c-stats.count>` counts up once and keeps its number. It used to fall back to 0 whenever the
  figure dropped below the window, and count again on the way back (#49).

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added

- A footer family. `<c-footer.columns>` puts the brand in one corner beside columns of links,
  `<c-footer.centred>` stacks a logo and one row of links on the centre line, `<c-footer.slim>` is
  a single line for application pages, and `<c-footer.banner>` opens with a heading and a slot for
  a form or a button. Each is the page's `footer` element, takes `logo`, `social` and
  `background` slots where it has room for them, and fills its columns with daisy-cotton's
  `<c-footer.nav>`. `<c-footer.brand>` and `<c-footer.legal>` are the brand corner and the
  copyright line they share, usable on their own.

### Changed

- The blocks now rely on daisyUI's `footer`, `footer-title` and `link-hover` classes from the
  project, all part of daisyUI 5.

## [v0.3.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- **Breaking.** Every class the stylesheet emits is prefixed `dce:`, and the blocks' markup uses
  the prefixed names: `dce:flex`, `dce:lg:grid-cols-2`. The stylesheet emits no unprefixed
  utility. A project that relied on it for a utility in its own templates, `py-20` or
  `bg-base-200` for instance, needs that class from its own build, or can write `dce:py-20`. CSS
  written against a block's old class names needs the new ones.
- A utility from the project's own build always beats one of the stylesheet's, whichever file is
  linked first, so a class passed to a block overrides the block's default.
- Type sizes, radii and container widths inside a block come from Tailwind's defaults and no
  longer follow a project that has redefined `--text-5xl` and the like. Colours and `--spacing`
  still follow the project. Setting the `--dce-` form of a property, `--dce-text-5xl`, overrides
  it for the blocks.

### Fixed

- The stylesheet no longer overrides a project's own responsive utilities. Linked after the
  project's stylesheet, as the README says to, its `.hidden` beat the project's `.md\:flex`, so
  an element written `hidden md:flex` in the project's templates stayed hidden at every width.
  `hidden lg:block`, `hidden sm:grid` and `sm:hidden` failed the same way.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- `<c-section>` and `<c-section.col>`. A section is the outer shell of a region of a page: it
  spans the page, takes a `background` slot and a `header` slot, and holds its content to the
  width `container` names. Each `<c-section.col>` inside it becomes a column, sharing the width by
  `span`, and they stack in the order written below the `lg` breakpoint. `reverse` runs them the
  other way at `lg` and above. A column takes a `background` slot of its own, and a section can
  sit inside another.
- `<c-heading>`, the short line, heading and supporting sentence that open a section or a hero,
  with `level`, `size` and `align`.
- Nine text effects, each an inline span around a few words: `<c-text.glow>`, `<c-text.outline>`
  and `<c-text.depth>`, which hold still, and `<c-text.gradient>`, `<c-text.shimmer>`,
  `<c-text.marker>`, `<c-text.typewriter>`, `<c-text.wave>` and `<c-text.glitch>`, which move. The
  movement is CSS only, each one renders the finished words under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and a
  looping effect takes `repeat` to stop it after a set number of runs.
- The reveal family. Five follow the scroll position:
  `<c-reveal.enter>` brings in whatever it wraps, `<c-reveal.cascade>` brings in its children one
  after another, `<c-reveal.wipe>` uncovers a picture from one edge, `<c-reveal.words>` lights a
  paragraph a word at a time and `<c-reveal.stack>` slides each panel over the one before.
  `<c-reveal.hover>` keeps a caption out of sight until its picture is pointed at or focused. The
  movement is CSS only. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, and in a browser without scroll-driven
  animation, the content is simply there.
- The quote family. `<c-quote.pull>`, `<c-quote.mark>`, `<c-quote.card>` and `<c-quote.bubble>` sit
  inside a page's own layout. `<c-quote.centred>`, `<c-quote.split>` and `<c-quote.wall>` are blocks
  that take the full width. `<c-quote.byline>` is the caption they share: a portrait, a name, and a
  role or a cited source. Each quote is a `figure` holding a `blockquote`.
- The stats family, built on daisy-cotton's `<c-stat>`. `<c-stats.trend>` shows how a figure has
  moved and comes in five more layouts that take the same attributes: `<c-stats.trend-inline>`,
  `<c-stats.trend-corner>`, `<c-stats.trend-centred>`, `<c-stats.trend-footer>` and
  `<c-stats.trend-row>`. `<c-stats.progress>` adds a bar towards a target, `<c-stats.count>` counts
  up as it scrolls into view, and `<c-stats.change>` is the arrow badge by itself.
  `<c-stats.band>`, `<c-stats.split>` and `<c-stats.headline>` are blocks that set figures out
  across a page. Every stat takes an optional `icon`. None draws a chart.
- Five sign-in pages and four sign-up pages, as blocks that fill the screen: `<c-sign-in.centred>`,
  `<c-sign-in.split>`, `<c-sign-in.floating>`, `<c-sign-in.stepped>` and `<c-sign-in.providers>`,
  and `<c-sign-up.pitch>`, `<c-sign-up.showcase>`, `<c-sign-up.bento>` and `<c-sign-up.stepped>`.
  Each is the layout only. The logo, the form and the buttons that skip the form arrive as slots,
  under the same names in all nine, so a django-allauth template fills them directly.
- `<c-auth.panel>`, the heading, provider buttons, divider, form and foot that seven of those pages
  draw their form in, with an optional card around it. For a page of the same kind that none of
  them covers.
- `<c-points>` and `<c-points.point>`, a short list of reasons with a tick or a mark of your own
  beside each.
- A translation catalogue, `locale/en`, for the few words the package supplies itself: the
  direction a trend stat reads out to a screen reader, a quote card's rating, and the word a
  sign-in page puts between its provider buttons and its form.

### Changed

- Every hero, quote and stats page block is built from `<c-section>`, and takes its eyebrow, title
  and lead from `<c-heading>` where it has them. `<c-stats.headline>` keeps its own heading, which
  joins the figure and its title. Attributes and slots are unchanged. The markup inside the
  section element is not: the content sits in a `div` carrying `data-section-body`, the columns of
  `<c-hero.split>`, `<c-quote.split>` and `<c-stats.split>` are `div` elements carrying
  `data-section-col`, and a reversed block no longer uses the `lg:order-1` and `lg:order-2`
  classes. Two things render differently. A hero given an empty `title` leaves the heading
  element out. `<c-stats.headline>` lets a figure run up to 64px wider before it wraps.

- The daisyUI classes a host is expected to provide now include `badge-soft`, `badge-sm`, the
  success, error and neutral badge colours, `progress` and its colours, `stat-figure` and
  `stat-actions`. All are in daisyUI 5.

- **Breaking.** The attribute that picks a theme colour is `variant`, the name daisy-cotton gives
  it, in place of `color`. It changes on `<c-hero.highlight>`, `<c-background.particles>` and
  `<c-background.hyperspace>`: `color="accent"` becomes `variant="accent"`. `color` is no longer
  recognised and renders the default. The text effects that take a theme colour, `<c-text.glow>`,
  `<c-text.outline>`, `<c-text.depth>`, `<c-text.shimmer>` and `<c-text.marker>`, use `variant` as
  well.
- daisy-cotton is now a dependency, and `daisy_cotton` goes in `INSTALLED_APPS`. The quote family
  shows a portrait with its `<c-avatar>`.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Six backgrounds that move: `<c-background.parallax>`, which wraps any other background and
  scrolls it more slowly than the page, and `<c-background.aurora>`, `<c-background.flow>`,
  `<c-background.horizon>`, `<c-background.particles>` and `<c-background.hyperspace>`. The
  movement is CSS only, and each one holds still under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Changed

- **Breaking.** Background attributes that set an amount take a number in place of a name:
  `intensity` on glow and grid, `opacity` on gradient and `dim` on image run from `0` to `1`, and
  `size` on grid is a length in rem. `intensity="bold"` becomes `intensity="0.3"`,
  `opacity="full"` becomes `opacity="1"`, `dim="strong"` becomes `dim="0.85"` and `size="lg"`
  becomes `size="5"`. A name is no longer recognised and renders the default.
- A background writes those numbers to its `style` attribute, as a custom property or as
  `opacity`. Under a content security policy that forbids inline styles they are ignored and the
  defaults apply.
- The hero blocks clip with `overflow: clip` in place of `overflow: hidden`, so a parallax
  background inside one can measure the block against the page.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- The hero family: `<c-hero.centred>`, `<c-hero.split>` and `<c-hero.showcase>`, which share one
  attribute and slot vocabulary, plus `<c-hero.highlight>` for marking words inside a heading.
- The background family: `<c-background.glow>`, `<c-background.gradient>`, `<c-background.grid>`
  and `<c-background.image>`. Each one goes in another block's `background` slot, so any background
  composes with any layout.
- Every block carries `@description`, `@prop` and `@slot` annotations. The example project builds
  each block's reference page from them, and `python manage.py cotton_lint` checks them.
- The stylesheet emits the palette, gradient, opacity and object-position utilities the background
  blocks compose while they render, which a scan of the templates cannot see.

### Changed

- The project is built and developed with uv instead of Poetry: `uv sync` installs the development
  environment and `uv.lock` replaces `poetry.lock`. The published package is unchanged.
- Django 6.1 is supported, and tested on every change alongside 5.2 and 6.0.
- Renamed from `django-mvp-bits` to `daisy-cotton-ext`. The import package is now
  `daisy_cotton_ext` and the stylesheet ships as `css/daisy-cotton-ext.css`.
- The package's scope covers extended components as well as page blocks: single components that
  go further than their daisyUI counterpart sit alongside the blocks.
- The package no longer requires django-mvp. It works on any Django project running Cotton and
  daisyUI, and `django-cotton` is now a declared dependency.
- The stylesheet carries the plain Tailwind utilities the blocks use, rather than only those a
  django-mvp build omits. Some rules will now appear both here and in a host's own build.
- Blocks are addressed without a namespace prefix, so a tag reads `<c-hero.centred>`. A project
  defining a component at the same path shadows this one, or is shadowed by it, depending on
  `INSTALLED_APPS` order.
