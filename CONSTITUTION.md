# daisy-cotton-ext Constitution

The standards every change to this repository is held to. Read at planning and at review.
Changes here are rare and deliberate, never made in the middle of a feature.

## Core articles

### Article I — Testing

Every change follows [`docs/contributing/standards/testing.md`](docs/contributing/standards/testing.md): what gets a test
and what does not, the test-first cycle, test structure and fixtures, and the coverage floors.

### Article II — Simplicity

Start with the simplest design that satisfies the spec. New dependencies, new abstractions and new
infrastructure each require a stated justification. YAGNI over speculation.

### Article III — Anti-Abstraction

No wrapper layers, base classes or future-proofing indirection without a present, concrete second
use. Prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction. A block that is nearly another block is still
its own template until a third one proves the shared shape.

### Article IV — Integration-First

Contracts and integration points are designed and tested before internals are polished. A block's
attribute surface is settled against a page that actually uses it, not in the abstract.

### Article V — Security & data-safety

Values interpolated into rendered output are escaped through Django's template layer, never by
hand-built string interpolation. A component attribute is untrusted input: an attribute that ends
up inside an `href`, a `src`, a `style` or an inline event handler is escaped for that context or
rejected, and `|safe` never appears without a stated reason. Secrets live in runtime config, never
in code, fixtures or version control.

### Article VI — Documentation

Public API changes ship their documentation in the same pull request: README and CHANGELOG
updated. Public surface here means a component, one of its attributes or slots, a template tag or
filter, and what the shipped stylesheet covers. Adding, renaming, removing
or changing the default of any of those leaves the work unfinished until the documentation says so.
Docstrings, component annotations and code comments follow
[`docs/contributing/standards/code-documentation.md`](docs/contributing/standards/code-documentation.md).

### Article VII — Dependency discipline

A new runtime dependency requires a stated justification, and `deptry` must pass: no unused,
missing or transitively-relied-upon dependencies. Python development tooling comes from the shared
`mvp-shared` bundle rather than per-repository pins. The Node dependencies are build tooling and
stay that way. Nothing under `node_modules` is ever a runtime requirement of the installed package,
which is the whole point of committing the built stylesheet.

### Article VIII — Internationalization

User-facing strings are translatable. In Python they are wrapped with `gettext_lazy`; templates
load `{% load i18n %}` and wrap strings with `{% trans %}` or `{% blocktrans %}`. A hard-coded
user-visible string in a pull request is a blocking comment.

Most blocks satisfy this by having no strings of their own — their text arrives from the template
author through attributes and slots. The article bites on the exceptions: a default label, a
placeholder, an ARIA label, a screen-reader-only heading. The first block that ships one also ships
the `locale/` directory and the base English catalog.

### Article IX — Cohesion (Python)

Related behaviour is grouped in a class, not scattered across module-level functions. Two or more
module-level functions belong on a class when they share a subject — the same data, the same first
argument, only meaningful in sequence, or named around the same noun.

In a published package a class is the extension point: a consumer who needs different behaviour
subclasses it and overrides one method, where a module of functions can only be monkey-patched.
Where Django already owns the grouping, use it rather than inventing a class.

This does not license abstraction. Article III still holds: one class grouping today's behaviour is
the goal, not a hierarchy built for a second implementation that does not exist.

**Django standards.** Where code lives in a Django codebase, and when a new abstraction is worth
adding, is set out in [`docs/contributing/standards/django.md`](docs/contributing/standards/django.md).

## Articles not adopted

- Data-model conventions (Django) — nothing here for it to govern.

That article covers model fields, indexing decisions and migration consolidation. This package
defines no models, and Article X forbids it from ever defining one. If that boundary is ever
crossed, the article is adopted in the same change that crosses it.

## Project articles

### Article X — No application surface

This package ships presentation and nothing else. No models, no views, no forms, no URLs, no
migrations, no management commands. A component's content arrives from the template author through
attributes and slots, never from a queryset.

Template tags and filters are permitted and expected to be rare. Each one is justified against the
alternative of doing the work in the calling template.

The boundary is what lets a project adopt this package without a database change or a deployment
step. When a block needs something on the far side of it, such as a model, a view mixin or a form,
that work belongs to the project or to a package that does own an application surface. It is never
reimplemented here.

### Article XI — The stylesheet carries what a host cannot

`daisy_cotton_ext/static/css/daisy-cotton-ext.css` is the one stylesheet this package ships,
and it exists for a single reason: a host's Tailwind build scans the host's own source, so the
plain utilities used inside this package's templates are absent from it. Four rules govern it, in
order of how load-bearing they are:

1. **Utilities only, and only the ones the blocks use.** The file is built by scanning this
   package's templates, with `@source inline(...)` covering what scanning cannot see — classes
   composed at render time, and the utilities the next blocks are being designed against.
2. **No daisyUI, no theme, no preflight.** All three belong to the host. `theme(reference)` gives
   the generator the scale without writing any of it out, and the emitted utilities resolve against
   the custom properties the host's daisyUI build defines on `:root`. That is also what makes a
   block follow whatever theme is active, for free.
3. **Every class it emits carries the `dce:` prefix, and shares no name with a host's.** Two
   stylesheets that both define `.hidden` leave link order to decide between one file's `hidden`
   and the other's `md:flex`, and no order is right for both files. A template writes
   `dce:flex`, never `flex`; daisyUI's classes stay unprefixed because they are the host's. The
   suite fails on an unprefixed class in the stylesheet, and measures both stylesheets together
   in a browser (`docs/adr/0012-package-utilities-carry-a-prefix.md`).
4. **The host contract is written down, never assumed.** The daisyUI classes a block may rely on
   are listed in `HOST_PROVIDED_CLASSES` in `tests/test_stylesheet.py`. Reaching for one that is
   not listed fails the suite, which is the prompt to decide whether a host should really be
   expected to provide it.

**An emitted class is not a built class.** Naming a class in the inline list is not proof it
produces a rule. A colour utility needs the semantic palette declared in the `@theme reference`
block or it silently produces nothing and the page renders unstyled markup.

**The built file is committed, and rebuilt on the branch that changes its input.** Installing the
package needs no Node toolchain, which is what the committed artifact buys. `npm test` and the
`Built stylesheet matches its source` check both fail when the committed file and its source
disagree.

### Article XII — Blocks are configured, not edited

A block is named for its role on the page, never for its implementation or an external design
system. Its attributes are the only supported way to change its presentation, and where a project
needs more control than they give, the answer is a template override rather than a wider attribute
surface.

**Layout is fixed per block, and an attribute never changes it.** A different arrangement is a
different block in the same family — `<c-hero.centred>` beside `<c-hero.split>` — not an option on
one component that branches internally. A block that grows a layout switch is two blocks that have
not been separated yet.

Colour comes from daisyUI's semantic palette (`primary`, `base-100` and the rest), never a literal
value and never a Tailwind palette name. That is what makes a page built from these blocks re-theme
with the rest of the site instead of drifting away from it.

Reusable markup is expressed as a Cotton component under `daisy_cotton_ext/templates/cotton/`,
named in lowercase-kebab form, never as an `{% include %}` partial. Blocks sit at the top of that
directory rather than under a prefix of their own, so a tag reads `<c-hero.centred>`. The cost is
accepted and real: a project defining its own `cotton/hero/centred.html` shadows this one, or is
shadowed by it, depending on `INSTALLED_APPS` order.

### Article XIII — Rendered markup is a contract

Components render valid, semantic HTML and are accessible by default: a real heading hierarchy,
alternative text where an image carries meaning, keyboard-reachable interactive elements, and ARIA
attributes only where the markup alone does not convey the role. Accessibility here covers the
markup this package emits. What a host project does with its own theme, contrast and content is
its own.

Every packaged component has a test proving it renders, and a change to markup structure updates or
adds a test asserting the part of the contract it changed. Assertions are made against rendered
output, not against the presence of a class name: a class assertion proves a string is in a
template and nothing about what the browser draws.

### Article XIV — Compatibility

The package is pre-1.0 and says so in the README. Block names, attribute surfaces and the set of
classes the stylesheet emits may change between minor versions, and every such change is recorded
in the CHANGELOG. Default behaviour stays stable across patch releases. There are no compatibility
aliases: an API is changed cleanly, and the CHANGELOG is how a project finds out.

Supported versions are Python 3.12 or later and the currently-supported Django releases, with the
CI matrix as the authoritative statement of both. Dropping either is a minor-version change with a
CHANGELOG entry.

**The daisyUI requirement is a compatibility surface and moves like one.** Blocks are written
against daisyUI 5. Adding a class from a later daisyUI to `HOST_PROVIDED_CLASSES` raises the floor
for every project installing this package, so it is a minor-version change with a CHANGELOG entry,
never a silent addition alongside the block that wanted it.

### Article XV — Nothing executable is fetched at page load

No block pulls a script, a font or a stylesheet from a third-party origin. Where a block needs
behaviour, it uses what the host project already runs, and any JavaScript this package ships of its
own is bundled rather than fetched.

This is a marketing-surface library, which is exactly the kind of code that attracts a CDN tag for
an animation library or a web font. A project that installs this package gains no external origin
it did not already have.

### Article XVI — A block documents itself, in its own template

Every packaged component carries its reference in annotation comments at the head of its own
template, in the format [django-cotton-gallery](https://github.com/velezanthony/django-cotton-gallery)
parses:

- `{# @description ... #}` — one line saying what the block is and when to reach for it.
- `{# @prop name:type | default:"..." | description:"..." #}` — one per attribute in `<c-vars>`,
  with `select['a', 'b']` where the attribute takes a fixed set of values.
- `{# @slot:name — what goes in it #}` — one per named slot the template renders.

Each annotation is a **single-line** Django comment. The lexer's `{#...#}` pattern does not cross a
newline, so a comment closed on a later line is not a comment at all and is served to the reader as
page text.

**These annotations are the only description of a block's attributes.** The component gallery builds
its live controls from them and each block's page in the example project builds its tables from the
same comments, so nothing restates them by hand. A second copy is a second thing to keep true, and
the one that drifts is always the one being read.

Three rules about what goes where, each of which has already cost time:

- **Slot names stay out of `<c-vars>`.** Cotton fills a named slot whether or not it is declared,
  and declaring one only keeps a same-named *attribute* out of `{{ attrs }}`, which nobody passes.
  Leaving them out lets the declaration mean one thing — the prop set — and lets it be checked
  against the `@prop` lines mechanically. With slot names mixed in, every one reads as an
  undocumented prop.
- **Never write the component's own tag out in angle brackets inside its comments.** The parser
  scans the raw source for the first occurrence and reads a mention inside a comment as the
  declaration itself, which reports every real prop as missing.
- **Reasoning lives below the annotations, in a `{% comment %}` block.** The one-liners are the
  reference. The comment underneath gives the why in three lines at most and points at the issue,
  pull request or ADR that holds a longer argument.

**This is gated, not encouraged.** `tests/test_annotations.py` runs the gallery's own linter over
every packaged component and fails on any issue it reports, at any severity, and separately checks
that each component has a description and an `@slot` for every named slot it renders. The linter
is the gallery's rather than ours on purpose: a second implementation of the format would drift
from the one that has to parse it, and the first symptom would be a page describing an attribute
that no longer exists.

## Quality bar

Read at planning and at review; applies to every change.

- Test coverage: **project ≥ 90%, patch ≥ 85%**, per `codecov.yml`. These are floors, not a ratchet
  toward 100%.
- Every public API change updates README and CHANGELOG in the same pull request.
- `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` and `deptry` pass — through
  `pre-commit run --all-files`, which is the gate, rather than a bare invocation that reports
  findings in paths the hooks exclude.
- The committed stylesheet matches its source, locally via `npm test` and in CI.
- Every packaged component's annotations lint clean, per Article XVI. `python manage.py cotton_lint`
  reports the same findings with a component gallery to look at them in.
- The package builds, its metadata is valid, and the README renders on the package index with
  absolute URLs.

`djlint` is configured in `pyproject.toml` and can be run over `daisy_cotton_ext/templates`, but it is
deliberately **not** a gate: it misfires against Cotton's `<c-vars>` syntax and needs ignore rules
first. Do not cite it as an enforced standard until it runs in CI.

## Non-negotiables

- One pull request per feature, and the repository owner merges it.
- Automation commits under the bot identity, never a human token. The default branch requires one
  approval, so the author and the approver are always distinct.
- Machine verification — tests, build, lint, the stylesheet check — gates every stage exit. No
  judgment call overrides a red gate.
